Intro
==
LaziiTV is a program that simulates the classic TV experience with video files that are stored on your computer.  It will only work with local video files saved to your computer and will not work with online videos like YouTube.  LaziiTV works by allowing you to define different channels and which video files will play on that channel.  When a channel is loaded, a random video will start playing.  LaziiTV also features expected functions like, changing the channel, pausing, and more.

How LaziiTV works
==
LaziiTV simulates the TV experience by allowing you to define channels which play certain video files, as well as different sets of channels. The main function consists of “modes”, which contain “channels”, which will be explained below.

Channels
==
A channel is a set of specific folders on your PC that contain video files that will be randomly chosen to play when the channel loads.  Do not put any files other than video files in folders that will be channels.

Example – Let’s say you have a folder called “The Office”. Inside that folder you have folders called, “Season 1” and “Season 2”. Those two folders each contain the video files that are the actual episodes of the The Office. And let’s say you have the exact same folder setup with another TV show and folder called “How I Met Your Mother”. Your channel would consist of the two folders: “The Office” and “How I Met Your Mother”. When that channel loads, it will randomly play a video from one of the folders inside “The Office” or “How I Met Your Mother”. 

A channel can contain as many folders/TV shows as you want. A channel can also have a name. You could have a channel called “Comedy” which contained The Office, How I Met Your Mother, Seinfeld, Parks and Recreation and much more! You could also have a channel called “Drama” which contains the folders/TV Shows like Suits and House of Cards. This setup would mimic standard TV; a channel that plays a specific type of show. But you can of course setup your channels to play whatever you want.

Note: You can only have video files in the directories that channels will use.  Other file types (like txt or doc) will crash the program.

Modes
==
A mode is a set of channels.

Example – Let’s say you have a mode called “Classic”. This mode will have channels that mimic classic TV. You have a Comedy channel, which have funny TV shows. You have a channel called Drama which has dramatic TV shows. You have a channel called Cartoons which plays cartoons. This setup would be nice for when you don’t really know what TV show you want to watch but you know you’re in the mood for something funny for instance.  But what if you know exactly what TV show you want to watch but you don’t care which episode plays or you don’t feel like setting up a playlist? You can create a new mode called “TV Shows”. In this mode, each channel would be a specific TV show. So when you load The Office channel, it would only play episodes of The Office.
