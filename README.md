LaziiTV
==
LaziiTV is a program that simulates the classic TV experience with video files that are stored on your computer.  It will only work with local video files saved to your computer and will not work with online videos like YouTube.  LaziiTV works by allowing you to define different channels and which video files will play on that channel.  When a channel is loaded, a random video will start playing.  LaziiTV also features expected functions like, changing the channel, pausing, and more.
